	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifa 16, a Soccer Video Game is now hitting video game stores worldwide. The game made by EA Canada, is the 23rd version of the game. EA Canada has created a new game every year since 1993 with the exception of 1994. The games of Fifa have improved so much over the years in so many ways. The game is supported on Xbox One, Xbox 360, PS4, and the PS3.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are playing the game singleplayer, you have an arrow over your head indicating who you are. You can play to up to 4 players and each player has its own unique color. You can sprint, walk, shoot, pass, dribble, and pretty much do everything in this game. There is an Online Multiplayer section, which you are able to play with people around the world. For that, you need a strong Wifi Signal and an EA Sports account. While you&#8217;re playing the game in any version, you have got to watch out for fouls. They happen often in this game, especially if you are new to the game. You always end up getting some yellow cards in every game, even some red cards as well.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key differences between Fifa 15 and Fifa 16 are that you are able to play as female teams that play differently than the male teams, Fifa 16 teaches you how to play better, easier defensive controls, much smarter AI (computer players), there are much less fast breaks, the goalkeepers are much smarter and don&#8217;t let as many goals pass. In Fifa 15, passing barely ever worked in any way and now, the AI&#8217;s are able to receive and pass balls. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AI&#8217;s can play as well as us humans can. They are fine-tuned to work at the same level as good humans. In Fifa 15, fouls didn't really ever count. Now they do!
