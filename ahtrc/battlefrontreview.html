	<h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chances are that you have seen <i>Star Wars</i>, a great series about the Jedi Knight and how they take on the Empire, a group of people who take control of the universe. Well, on November 17th 2015, a new game called <i>Star Wars: Battlefront came out.</i> If you are a fan of <i>Star Wars</i>, then you will love this new game. <i>Battlefront</i> is a game where you can play from a small variety of your favorite characters from the movie such as Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and more. Plus, with different Battle Modes you can destroy your enemies and become the best in the whole galaxy. Play Hero Hunt and blast your way to victory as a Stormtrooper, or the rebellion, if you win, you choose which hero or villain you use to kill all of your enemies, or, you can play a friendly match with your friend in a one on one battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If neither of those work for you, how about some Heroes vs. Villains where you can be on either side, fighting your opponents with no one but your fellow stormtroopers or rebels. If you don&#8217;t think your weapons are good enough for battles, go get some credits by fighting your way through back to back battles against the other side. Play as characters and go on awesome missions just like Luke Skywalker did in the original movies. Go from arenas with freezing cold piles of ice, to warm rainforest weather, to dry desert lands with huge sand dunes with huge hot springs with deadly boiling hot water. In my opinion, I would rate this game at a 10 out of 10.
